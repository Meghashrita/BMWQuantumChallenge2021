**Quantum neural networks** are computational neural network models which are based on the principles of quantum mechanics and acts application-agnostic computational units that can be used for many different use cases : like Image Processing , Natural Language Processing, computer games, function approximation, handling big data, in modelling social networks, associative memory devices, and automated control systems etc.

In **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**, Quantum kernels is the approach of exploiting group structure in data which helps to achieve quantum speedup ( but not mandatory). Quantum kernels can be optimized with a technique called kernel alignment.

Different quantum computing methods are used to encode classical data in a quantum-enhanced feature space. For computing quantum kernels, an algorithm called  Quantum kernel estimator (QKE) is  used which leverages quantum circuits for classical data and provides an efficient way to evaluate inner products between data in a quantum feature space.

Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) are parameterized quantum circuits which acts like linear methods in quantum feature space  and suitable case for using quantum kernels and in turn can be optimized using Quantum Kernel Alignment.
